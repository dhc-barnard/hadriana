<p>Nathalie Jolivert is a Haitian architect and artist based in New York City. She was first introduced to René Depestre’s novel “Hadriana in All my Dreams” while doing research in Jacmel for her undergraduate degree project at the Rhode Island School of Design. Jolivert’s project focused on the architectural preservation of Le Manoir Alexandra, Hadriana’s prominent villa in the center of town. In her studies, Jolivert felt enthralled by the young French protagonist’s mystical story, which has haunted Jacmel for generations. In her research, she connected with various artists, literary scholars and architectural preservationists and quickly understood the important role this novel played in memorializing the essence of a city that prides itself as the cultural capital of Haiti. It is this process that resulted in ….Nathalie Jolivert 
As a multi-media artist, Nathalie remains passionate about spatial narratives, cultural and architectural preservation, urbanism and environmental issues. Her exhibitions include ‘Bonjour Tristesse’ at Barney Savage Gallery in New York, 2018, ‘Lavi Miyò’ at FiveMyles Gallery in New York, 2018, ‘Curiosités Urbaines’ at La Lorraine in Port-au-Prince, 2016, and ‘Frontiers of Development’ at the Ronald Reagan building and International Trade Center in Washington, DC, 2014 </p>

<div id="columns-2"> <h1>Tessa Mars</h1> <img src="/hadriana/img/tessa.jpg" /><p>Tessa Mars was born in 1985 in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, where she continues to live and work. She completed a bachelor in Visual Arts in France, at Rennes 2 University in 2006. Her artistic career truly begins in 2008 with her participation in the 5th Transcultural Forum of Contemporary art organized by the AfricAmericA Foundation in Port-au-Prince. Three years later she’s part of the collective exhibition Haiti Kingdom of This world (2011). This traveling exhibition presented initially at the Agnès b. gallery in Paris inaugurated the first Haitian pavilion at the Venice Biennale the same year. In 2015, the artist spent three months at the Alice Yard space in Trinidad and Tobago, as part of an artistic residency. It is during this stay that she creates the character of Tessalines, her alter ego, a female hybrid of Jean Jacques Dessalines, leader of the Haitian revolution. The work produced during this residency marks a turning point in her career and gives rise to an exhibition at the French Institute of Port-au-Prince, Tessalines and Moi, her first solo show. Linking past and present, Mars’s recent work offers alternate narratives on past and current traumas both personal and collective as a means of empowerment and healing. The work questions the processes through which we build ourselves as individuals and groups. Looking at identity through the lens of gender, history and culture, she questions notions of belonging, sacrifice, transformation and resistance. Mars’s work has been most recently shown during the 10th Berlin Biennale in 2018, and in 2019 with her Solo show Île modèle-Manman zile-Island template in Port-au-Prince.
