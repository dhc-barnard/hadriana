Coming February 2020

In All My Dreams is a collective, multivalent project situated at the intersections between literature, history, and visual art in the Caribbean. Contemporary Haitian artists Nathalie Jolivert, Tessa Mars, and Mafalda Mondestin offer up a visual dialogue with famed Haitian author René Depestre’s novel Hadriana In All My Dreams. In advance of the unveiling of their work in February 2020, join us here for glimpses of the emerging artwork and monthly conversations about the novel.
